# Wallet SDK

The TrustBloc Wallet SDK repo contains APIs to receive and present [W3C Verifiable Credentials(VCs)](https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/) 
signed using [W3C Decentralized Identifiers(DIDs)](https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/). These APIs are useful for the holder 
role defined in the [W3C VC Specification](https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/#dfn-holders).

The project contains the following source code components and build scripts for SDKs.
- Go SDK
  - Build native Go applications using the [core pkg](pkg).
- Android and iOS SDK
  - [A gomobile-compatible Go SDK](cmd/wallet-sdk-gomobile)
    - For generating gomobile-compatible bindings (see below).
    - To jump straight to usage documentation, see [here](cmd/wallet-sdk-gomobile/docs/usage.md).
  - [Scripts to generate Android and iOS-compatible bindings](cmd/wallet-sdk-gomobile/README.md)
    - Allows the Go SDK to be used in an Android or iOS app.
- EXPERIMENTAL: WebAssembly(WASM)/JavaScript(JS) SDK
  - [Scripts to generate JavaScript/WebAssembly(WASM) bindings](cmd/wallet-sdk-js/README.md)
    - Allows the Go SDK to be used in a Web Application. Refer SDK usage guide [here](cmd/wallet-sdk-js/docs/usage.md).

The repo also has code to generate a [Reference iOS, Android or Web App](demo/app/) built using the [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/) framework.

## Specifications

The TrustBloc Wallet SDK implements following specifications.
- W3C [Verifiable Credential Data Model (VCDM)](https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/)
- W3C [Decentralized Identifier (DID)](https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/)
- OIDF [OpenID for Verifiable Credential Issuance](https://openid.net/specs/openid-4-verifiable-credential-issuance-1_0.html)
  - Pre Authorization Code flow
  - Authorization Code low
- OIDF [OpenID for Verifiable Presentation](https://openid.net/specs/openid-4-verifiable-presentations-1_0.html)
- DIF [Presentation Exchange](https://identity.foundation/presentation-exchange/)
- DIF [Well Known DID Configuration](https://identity.foundation/.well-known/resources/did-configuration/)

## Build/Run
- [GoMobile Bindings (iOS/Android)](cmd/wallet-sdk-gomobile/README.md)
- [JavaScript/WebAssembly(WASM) Bindings](cmd/wallet-sdk-js/README.md)
- [Demo/Reference App](demo/app/README.md)

## Library/Package

### Android
The Wallet SDK Android package is available on GitHub Maven Repository. Please refer 
[wallet-sdk maven packages](https://github.com/trustbloc/wallet-sdk/packages/1769347) for the latest releases.

```
<dependency>
  <groupId>dev.trustbloc</groupId>
  <artifactId>vc-wallet-sdk</artifactId>
  <version>1.0.0</version>
</dependency>
```

Refer [here](./cmd/wallet-sdk-gomobile/README.md#helpful-tips) for using the android package in your project.

#### Gradle Config

Add the following GitHub maven repository to dependencyResolutionManagement.repositories
```
maven {
  url = $URL
  credentials {
    username = $GITHUB_USER
    password = $GITHUB_TOKEN
  }
 }
```

Use the following URL based on snapshot or release dependency:
RELEASE_REPO_URL=https://maven.pkg.github.com/trustbloc/wallet-sdk

### iOS
The Wallet SDK iOS xcframework packages are distributed through Swift Package Manager (SPM). Please refer
[wallet-sdk tags](https://github.com/trustbloc/wallet-sdk/tags) with the suffix `-swift-pm` (e.g., `1.0.0-swift-pm`) for the
latest releases.

### Web
The Wallet SDK JS package is distributed through npm. Please refer to 
[wallet-sdk-js package](https://github.com/trustbloc-cicd/snapshot/pkgs/npm/wallet-sdk-js) for the latest snapshot releases.

#### Web Config
The distributed package contains the WASM build file (`wallet-sdk.wasm`) inside `node_modules/@trustbloc-cicd/wallet-sdk-js/dist`,
which you may want to store in a different location within your project along with other assets.
In such case, you need to provide the path to the location of the WASM build file through
the `opts.assestPath` parameter when you create an Agent instance:
```js
const kmsDatabase = await CreateDB("test")
agent = new Agent({assetsPath: "path-to-folder-with-wallet-sdk-wasm-file", didResolverURI:didResolverURI, kmsDatabase: kmsDatabase});
await agent.initialize();
```

## Project structure

The Go SDK is defined in [pkg](pkg). If you want to build a native Go application, then this is what you'd use.

The `gomobile`-compatible version of the aforementioned Go SDK is defined in [cmd/wallet-sdk-gomobile](cmd/wallet-sdk-gomobile). It's similar to the [Go SDK](pkg), except that the various functions, methods, and interfaces only use a subset of Go types that are compatible with the `gomobile` tool. The `gomobile`-compatible SDK generally acts as a wrapper for the [Go SDK](pkg). Internally, it converts between the `gomobile`-compatible types and the types used by the [Go SDK](pkg) as needed.
