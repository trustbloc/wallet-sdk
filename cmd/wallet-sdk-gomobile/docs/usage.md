# SDK Usage

Last updated: April 11, 2023 (commit `f2fb58089f254110339ff2605374966660e8063c`)

This guide explains how to use this SDK in Android or iOS code. The examples in this document demonstrate
how to use the various APIs from a Kotlin and Swift perspective.

The languages for the generated bindings are Java (for Android) and Objective-C (for iOS).

For the sake of readability, the following is omitted in most code examples:
* Error handling
* Nullable type checks (in Kotlin examples)
* Optionals unwrapping (in Swift examples)

## General API Patterns

Wallet-SDK APIs follow a certain pattern. Arguments to functions and methods are always mandatory unless
they are in an `Opts` object. If a function or method has an `Opts` argument, it will be the last
argument (after all the mandatory arguments). The exact name of this object may differ depending on the function/method,
but they will all have `Opts` in the name.

`Opts` objects are created by calling their constructors, which always have zero arguments.
To set specific options, use the exposed methods available on the object after you've created it.

If an optional argument is not explicitly set then a default will be used.

If no optional arguments are needed, you can simply pass in `null`/`nil` as the `Opts` argument, which will
result in defaults being used for all the options.

Note that in some circumstances, some options may be required (e.g. if an issuer requires a PIN). See the documentation
for the particular function/method for more information.

## Error Handling

Errors from Wallet-SDK come in a structured format that can be (optionally) parsed, allowing for individual fields to be accessed.

Errors have three fields:

* Category: A short descriptor of the general category of error.
* Code: A short alphanumeric code that is used to broadly group various related errors.
This contains the Category descriptor.
* Details: Lower-level details about the precise cause of the error.
* TraceID: ID of Open Telemetry root trace. Can be used to trace API calls. Only present on certain APIs.

### Examples

#### Kotlin (Android)

```kotlin
import dev.trustbloc.wallet.sdk.walleterror.Walleterror

try {
    // Some code here
} catch (e: Exception) {
    val parsedError = Walleterror.parse(e.message)
    // Access parsedError.code, parsedError.category, and parsedError.details as you see fit
}
```

#### Swift (iOS)

Note: For error parsing, make sure you pass `localizedDescription` from the `NSError` object into the
`WalleterrorParse` function. Passing in `description` will cause the parsing to not work correctly.

```swift
import Walletsdk

do {
    try someSDKObject.someMethodHere()
} catch let error as NSError {
    let parsedError = WalleterrorParse(error.localizedDescription)
    // Access parsedError.code, parsedError.category, and parsedError.details as you see fit
}
```

## API Package

The API package contains various interfaces and types that are used across multiple places in the SDK.
Wallet-SDK contains implementations of these various interfaces that can be used to get an application up and running
fairly quickly.
Implementations of these interfaces can be done in on the mobile side and injected in to the API methods that use them.
A few examples of when you might want to do this:
* Implementing platform-specific crypto functionality (perhaps leveraging device-specific security chips)
* Implement a custom LD document loader that uses preloaded local contexts for performance and/or security reasons.
See [LD Document Loading](#ld-document-loading) for more information.

### KeyWriter and KeyReader

The KeyWriter and KeyReader interfaces appear in various places across Wallet-SDK.

The `KeyWriter` interface has a single method called `create` defined on it which accepts a `keyType` argument.
Wallet-SDK expects that `KeyWriter` implementations also store the keys they create for later retrieval.

The `KeyReader` interface has a single method called `exportPubKey` defined on it which accepts a `keyID` argument.
Wallet-SDK expects this method to return the public key associated with the given `keyID` argument.

If either one of these behaviours is not implemented, then certain Wallet-SDK functionality will not work as expected:
* DID creation, credential issuance, and credential presentation will fail since keys won't be found


### Verifiable Credentials

Verifiable Credential objects are present throughout Wallet-SDK. They have a number of useful methods:

* `serialize()`: Returns a serialized representation of this VC. This is useful for storing VCs in a persistent
database. To convert the serialized representation back into a `Credential` object,
see [Parsing Credentials](#parsing-credentials).
* `id()`: Returns this VC's ID.
* `issuerID()`: Returns the ID of this VC's issuer (typically a DID).
* `name()`: Returns this VC's name.
If the VC doesn't provide a name (or the name is not a string), then an empty string is returned.
* `types()`: Returns the types of this VC. At a minimum, one of the types will be "VerifiableCredential".
There may be additional more specific credential types as well.
* `claimTypes()`: Returns the types specified in the claims of this VC. If none are found, then null/nil is returned.
* `issuanceDate()`: Returns this VC's issuance date as a Unix timestamp.
* `expirationDate()`: Returns this VC's expiration date as a Unix timestamp.

## Parsing Credentials

Serialized credentials cannot be used directly in Wallet-SDK. Instead, they must be parsed first.

The `parseCredential` function is located in the `Verifiable` package. It has a few optional arguments that can be
passed in via the methods available on the `Opts` object:
* `disableProofCheck`: Disables the proof check operation when parsing the VC. The proof check can be an expensive
operation - in certain scenarios, it may be appropriate to disable the check. By default, proofs are checked.
* `setDocumentLoader`: Specifies a JSON-LD document loader to use when parsing the VC. If none is specified, then a
network-based loader will be used.

Passing in `null`/`nil` will cause all default options to be used.

### Examples

#### Kotlin (Android)

##### Using Default Options

```kotlin
import dev.trustbloc.wallet.sdk.verifiable.Verifiable

val vc = Verifiable.parseCredential("Serialized VC goes here", null)
```

##### Using Specified Options

```kotlin
import dev.trustbloc.wallet.sdk.verifiable.Opts
import dev.trustbloc.wallet.sdk.verifiable.Verifiable

val opts = Opts().disableProofCheck()
val vc = Verifiable.parseCredential("Serialized VC goes here", opts)
```

#### Swift (iOS)

##### Using Default Options

```swift
import Walletsdk

var error: NSError?
let vc = VerifiableParseCredential("Serialized VC goes here", nil, &error)
```

##### Using Specified Options

```swift
import Walletsdk

var error: NSError?
let opts = VerifiableNewOpts()?.disableProofCheck()
let vc = VerifiableParseCredential("Serialized VC goes here", opts, &error)
```

## LD Document Loading

Several APIs allow for an LD document loader to be specified via the `setDocumentLoader` method on their respective
`Opts` objects.
If no custom LD document loader is specified (or is nil/null), then network-based document loading will be used instead.
For performance and/or security reasons, you may wish to implement a custom LD document loader that uses
preloaded local contexts.

## Network Call Timeout

By default, REST calls in Wallet-SDK have a timeout of 30 seconds. This can be overridden by passing in a
custom timeout via the `setHTTPTimeoutNanoseconds` method, which, if available, will be on the API's `Opts` object.
Passing in 0 will disable timeouts.

## In-Memory Credential Storage

The credential package contains an in-memory credential storage implementation that can be used to store credentials
in memory and also satisfy the `Reader` interface (in the `Credential` package). As it only uses in-memory storage,
it's generally only suitable for testing purposes. You will probably want to create your own implementation in your
mobile code that uses platform-specific storage.

### Examples

#### Kotlin (Android)

```kotlin
import dev.trustbloc.wallet.sdk.credential.InMemoryDB
import dev.trustbloc.wallet.sdk.verifiable.Verifiable

val db = InMemoryDB()

val vc = Verifiable.parseCredential("Serialized VC goes here", null)

db.add(vc)

val retrievedVC = db.get("VC_ID")

val retrievedVCs = db.getAll()

db.remove("VC_ID")
```

#### Swift (iOS)

```swift
import Walletsdk

let db = CredentialNewInMemoryDB()

var error: NSError?
let vc = VerifiableParseCredential("Serialized VC goes here", nil, &error)!

db.add(vc)

let retrievedVC = db.get("VC_ID")

let retrievedVCs = db.getAll()

db.remove("VC_ID")
```

## Local KMS
This package contains a local KMS implementation that uses Google's Tink crypto library.
Private keys may intermittently reside in local memory with this implementation so
keep this consideration in mind when deciding whether to use this or not.
The caller must inject a key store for the KMS to use. This package includes an in-memory key store implementation
that can be used, but you will likely want to inject in your own implementation at some point so your keys are
persisted.

### Examples

#### Kotlin (Android)

```kotlin
import dev.trustbloc.wallet.sdk.localkms.Localkms
import dev.trustbloc.wallet.sdk.localkms.MemKMSStore

val memKMSStore = MemKMSStore.MemKMSStore()
val kms = Localkms.newKMS(memKMSStore)

val jwk1 = kms.create(localkms.KeyTypeED25519)
val jwk2 = kms.create(localkms.KeyTypeP384)
```

#### Swift (iOS)

```swift
import Walletsdk

let memKMSStore = LocalkmsNewMemKMSStore()

var error: NSError?
let kms = LocalkmsNewKMS(memKMSStore, &error)

let jwk1 = kms.create(LocalkmsKeyTypeED25519)
let jwk2 = kms.create(LocalkmsKeyTypeP384)
```

## DID Creator

The DID creator can be used to create DIDs using various supported DID methods.

It needs to be instantiated with a KeyWriter implementation. As part of the DID creation process, one or more keys
need to be created - the KeyWriter is used to create any required keys as needed.

Call the `create` method to create a new DID. The `method` parameter is required and must be specified. The
following DID methods are supported: `key`, `ion`, and `jwk`.

The following optional arguments can be passed in via the methods available on the `CreateOpts` object:
* `setVerificationType`: Sets the verification type to use. If not set, then an appropriate default for the given
DID method will be used.
* `setKeyType`: Sets the key type to use for keys generated during DID creation.
If not set, then Ed25519 keys will be generated. Note that when using the `ion` DID method, update and recovery keys
will also be generated. The key type used for generation of these update and recovery keys is not affected by this
option. They will always be ECDSA P-256 keys.
* `setMetricsLogger`: Sets a metrics logger to use for capturing performance metrics events. If not set, then
no performance metrics events will be logged.

### Examples

These examples make use of the [in-memory KMS](#local-kms) implementation as the KeyWriter.

#### Kotlin (Android)

##### Using Default Options

```kotlin
import dev.trustbloc.wallet.sdk.did.Creator
import dev.trustbloc.wallet.sdk.localkms.Localkms
import dev.trustbloc.wallet.sdk.localkms.MemKMSStore

val memKMSStore = MemKMSStore.MemKMSStore()
val kms = Localkms.newKMS(memKMSStore)
val didCreator = Creator(kms as KeyWriter)

val didDocResolution = didCreator.create("key", null)
```

##### Using Specified Options

```kotlin
import dev.trustbloc.wallet.sdk.did.*
import dev.trustbloc.wallet.sdk.localkms.Localkms
import dev.trustbloc.wallet.sdk.localkms.MemKMSStore

val memKMSStore = MemKMSStore.MemKMSStore()
val kms = Localkms.newKMS(memKMSStore)
val didCreator = Creator(kms as KeyWriter)

val createDIDOpts = CreateOpts().setKeyType("ED25519").setVerificationType("JsonWebKey2020")
val didDocResolution = didCreator.create("key", createDIDOpts)
```

#### Swift (iOS)

##### Using Default Options

```swift
import Walletsdk

let memKMSStore = LocalkmsNewMemKMSStore()

var newKMSError: NSError?
let kms = LocalkmsNewKMS(memKMSStore, &newKMSError)

var newDIDCreatorError: NSError?
let didCreator = DidNewCreator(kms, &newDIDCreatorError)

let didDocResolution = didCreator.create("key", nil)
```

##### Using Specified Options

```swift
import Walletsdk

let memKMSStore = LocalkmsNewMemKMSStore()

var newKMSError: NSError?
let kms = LocalkmsNewKMS(memKMSStore, &newKMSError)

var newDIDCreatorError: NSError?
let didCreator = DidNewCreator(kms, &newDIDCreatorError)

let opts = DidNewCreateOpts().setKeyType("ED25519").setVerificationType("JsonWebKey2020")
let didDocResolution = didCreator.create("key", opts)
```

## DID Resolver

A DID resolver can be used to resolve DIDs.

A resolver can be created with an optional resolver server URI, which will only be used for resolving DIDs that
require a remote resolver server.

### Examples

#### Kotlin (Android)

##### Using Default Options

```kotlin
import dev.trustbloc.wallet.sdk.did.*

val didResolver = did.Resolver(null)

val didDoc = didResolver.resolve("did:key:z6MkhaXgBZDvotDkL5257faiztiGiC2QtKLGpbnnEGta2doK")
```

##### Using Specified Options

```kotlin
import dev.trustbloc.wallet.sdk.did.*

val opts = ResolverOpts().setResolverServerURI("https://example.com/")
val didResolver = did.Resolver(opts)

val didDoc = didResolver.resolve("did:key:z6MkhaXgBZDvotDkL5257faiztiGiC2QtKLGpbnnEGta2doK")
```

#### Swift (iOS)

##### Using Default Options

```swift
import Walletsdk

let didResolver = DidNewResolver(nil)

let didDoc = didResolver.resolve("did:key:z6MkhaXgBZDvotDkL5257faiztiGiC2QtKLGpbnnEGta2doK")
```

##### Using Specified Options

```swift
import Walletsdk

let resolverOpts = DidNewResolverOpts()?.setResolverServerURI("https://example.com/")
let didResolver = DidNewResolver(resolverOpts)

let didDoc = didResolver.resolve("did:key:z6MkhaXgBZDvotDkL5257faiztiGiC2QtKLGpbnnEGta2doK")
```

## DID Service Validation

Note the following limitations:
* The DID document associated with the DID you want to check must specify only a single service.
* If there are multiple URLs for a given service, only the first will be checked.

### Examples

#### Kotlin (Android)

```kotlin
import dev.trustbloc.wallet.sdk.did.*

val didResolver = Resolver(null)

val validationResult = Did.validateLinkedDomains("YourDIDHere", didResolver)
```

#### Swift (iOS)

```swift
import Walletsdk

let didResolver = DidNewResolver(nil)

let validationResult = ValidateLinkedDomains("YourDIDHere", didResolver)
```

## OpenID4CI

The OpenID4CI package contains an API that can be used by a [holder](https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/#dfn-holders)
to go through the [OpenID4CI](https://openid.net/specs/openid-4-verifiable-credential-issuance-1_0-11.html) flow.

### Creating the `Interaction` Object

The first step in any OpenID4CI flow is to create an `Interaction` object. An `Interaction` object is instantiated
using an `InteractionArgs` object and, optionally, an `InteractionOpts` object. The `Interaction` object is stateful.
Use it for only one single instance of an OpenID4CI flow and then discard it.
Create a new `Interaction` object _every time_ you go through the OpenID4CI flow.

An `InteractionArgs` object contains the following mandatory parameters:
* An initiate issuance URI obtained from an issuer (e.g. via a QR code).
* A crypto implementation.
* A DID resolver.

To set optional arguments, create an `InteractionOpts` object and use the supplied methods available on that object.
The following methods (options) are available:
* `setActivityLogger`: If set, then credential activity logs will be passed to the given `ActivityLogger`
  implementation. Otherwise, no activities will be logged.
* `setDocumentLoader`: Used when parsing JSON-LD VCs. If unspecified, then a network-based loader will be used, which
  can impact performance.
* `setMetricsLogger`: If set, then performance metrics events will be passed to the given `MetricsLogger`
  implementation. Otherwise, no metrics events will be logged.
* `setHTTPTimeoutNanoseconds`: Specifies a timeout for REST calls. Defaults to 30 seconds if not set.
* `disableOpenTelemetry`: Disables the sending of OpenTelemetry headers. By default, they are sent during REST calls
  to the issuer and during OAuth2-related calls (if applicable).
* `addHeader`: Allows you to set an additional header to be sent during REST calls to the issuer and during
OAuth2-related calls (if applicable).
* `addHeaders`: Like `addHeader`, but allows you to specify multiple headers at once.
* `disableHTTPClientTLSVerify`: Disables TLS verification for HTTPS calls. **This should
  be used for testing purposes only**.
* `disableVCProofChecks`: Disables proof checks for Verifiable Credentials received from the issuer. **This should
be used for testing purposes only**.

If you're okay with all defaults being used, you can simply pass in `null`/`nil` in as the `InteractionOpts` argument.

Note that options can also be set by chaining the methods together on a single line.
For example: `newInteractionOpts().setActivityLogger(...).setHeaders(...)`

### Authorization

In this part, the actions you have to take vary greatly depending on whether you're using the Pre-Authorized Code flow
or the Authorization Code Flow.

First, you should check and see what grant types the issuer says they support. You can do this by checking the issuer's
capabilities, which you can do by calling the `issuer` method on the `Interaction`, and then calling the `capabilities`
method on that `Issuer`. Then, use the available methods on the `Capabilities` object:
* `preAuthorizedCodeGrantTypeSupported`: Indicates whether the issuer supports the pre-authorized code grant type. If it
 does, then you can proceed with the [pre-authorized code flow](#pre-authorized-code-flow).
* `authorizationCodeGrantTypeSupported`: Indicates whether the issuer supports the authorization code grant type. If it
  does, then you can proceed with the [authorization code flow](#authorization-code-flow).

#### Pre-Authorized Code Flow

For the pre-authorized code flow, you need to determine whether the issuer requires a PIN or not. To do this, first get
the `PreAuthorizedCodeGrantParams` object by calling the `preAuthorizedCodeGrantParams` method on your
`Capabilities` object. Then, use the `pinRequired` method to determine whether a PIN is needed or not. Once you
know this, you're ready to [request credentials](#request-credential).

#### Authorization Code Flow

First, you need to create an authorization URL. To do this, call the `createAuthorizationURL` method on the
`Interaction` object. You need to provide the following parameters:
* Client ID: This is a value that's specific to your application and/or issuer. The Client ID is a part of 
the OAuth2 specification, and has to be obtained by out-of-band means.
* Redirect URI: The URI that you want the service to redirect to after authorization is complete.
You will likely want this to be some sort of deep link to your app. More information on this can be found further below.

Additionally, some issuers' authorization servers may require scopes to be passed in. In this case, use the `setScopes`
method on the `CreateAuthorizationURLOpts` object to pass in scopes. The `scopes` value is also part of the
OAuth2 specification and needs to be obtained by out-of-band means.

Once you have your authorization URL, load it in a web browser. The user will then need to log in to the service
(if they are not already) and give permission to share their data with the issuer. The web page will then
redirect the user to the redirect URI that you passed in previously. However, this redirect URI will now have
additional query parameters appended to it. You will need this full URI for the next step, and so you will probably
want the redirect URI (passed in earlier) to be some sort of deep link to your app so that you can easily retrieve this
URI.

You're now ready to [request credentials](#request-credential).

### Request Credential

There are two methods available on the `Interaction` object to request credentials. Which one you use will depend
on your flow:
* `requestCredentialWithPreAuth`: Use this only if you're using the pre-authorized code flow. If a PIN is required,
pass it in using the `setPIN` method on the `RequestCredentialWithPreAuthOpts` object.
* `requestCredentialWithAuth`: Use this only if you're using the authorization code flow. This version of the method
  will require the redirect URI (that has additional query parameters) that you got before.

Regardless of which of the two methods you use, if the call succeeds, it will return your issued credentials.
These can then be used in other Wallet-SDK APIs or [serialized for storage](#verifiable-credentials).

### Issuer URI (Optional)

You can get the issuer's URI by first calling the `issuer` method on the `Interaction` object, and then the `uri` method
on the `Issuer` object. The issuer URI can be used to get the display data for your credentials.
See [Credential Display Data](#credential-display-data) for more information.
You may want to save the issuer URI somewhere so that you can get/refresh display data at a later time.

### Examples

The following examples show how to use the APIs to go through the OpenID4CI flow using the iOS and Android bindings.
They use in-memory key storage and the Tink crypto library.

## Credential Display Data

After completing the `RequestCredential` step of the OpenID4CI flow, you will have your issued Verifiable Credential
objects. These objects contain the data needed for various wallet operations, but they don't tell you how you can
display the credential data in an easily-understandable way via a user interface. This is where the credential display
data comes in.

To get display data, call the `resolveDisplay` function with your VCs and the issuer URI. An issuer URI can be obtained by
calling the `issuerURI` method on an OpenID4CI interaction object after it's been instantiated. It's a good idea to
store the issuer URI somewhere in persistent storage after going through the OpenID4CI flow. This way, you can call the
`resolveDisplay` function later if/when you need to refresh your display data based on the latest display information
from the issuer. See [Resolve Display](#resolve-display) for more information.

Display data objects can be serialized using the `serialize()` method (useful for storage) and parsed from serialized
form back into display data objects using the `parseDisplayData()` function.

The structure of the display data object is as follows:

### `Data`

* The root object.
* Contains display information for the issuer and each of the credentials passed in to the `resolveDisplay`
function.
* Can be serialized using the `serialize()` method and parsed using the `parseDisplayData()` function.
* The `issuerDisplay()` method returns the `IssuerDisplay` object.
* Use the `credentialDisplaysLength()` and `credentialDisplayAtIndex()` methods to iterate over the `CredentialDisplay`
  objects. There's one for each credential passed in to the `resolveDisplay` function, and they're in the same order.

### `IssuerDisplay`

* Describes display information about the issuer.
* Can be serialized using the `serialize()` method and parsed using the `parseIssuerDisplay()` function.
* Has `name()` and `locale()` methods.

### `CredentialDisplay`

* Describes display information about a credential.
* Can be serialized using the `serialize()` method and parsed using the `parseCredentialDisplay()` function.
* The `overview()` method returns the `CredentialOverview` object.
* Use the `claimsLength()` and `claimAtIndex()` methods to iterate over the `Claim` objects.

### `CredentialOverview`

* Describes display information for a credential as a whole.
* Has `name()`, `logo()`, `backgroundColor()`, `textColor()`, and `locale()` methods. The `logo()` method returns
  a `Logo` object.

### `Logo`

* Describes display information for a logo.
* Has `url()` and `altText()` methods.

### `Claim`

* Describes display information for a specific claim within a credential.
* Has `label()`, `rawID()`, `valueType()`, `value()`, `rawValue()`, `isMasked()`, `hasOrder()`, `order()`,
`pattern()`, and `locale()` methods.
* For example, if the UI were to display "Given Name: Alice", then `label()` would correspond to "Given Name" while
  `value()` would correspond to "Alice".
* Display order data is optional and will only exist if the issuer provided it. Use the `hasOrder()` method
to determine if there is a specified order before attempting to retrieve the order, since `order()` will return an
error/throw an exception if the claim has no order information. If you've ensured that the claim has an order
(by using `hadOrder()`), then you can safely ignore the error/exception from the `order()` method.
* `IsMasked()` indicates whether this claim's value is masked. If this method returns true, then the `value()` method
will return the masked value while the `rawValue()` method will return the unmasked version.
* `rawValue()` returns the raw display value for this claim without any formatting.
For example, if this claim is masked, this method will return the unmasked version.
If no special formatting was applied to the display value, then this method will be equivalent to calling Value.
* `rawID()` returns the claim's ID, which is the raw field name (key) from the VC associated with this claim.
It's not localized or formatted for display.
* `valueType()` returns the value type for this claim - when it's "image", then you should expect the value data to be
formatted using the [data URL scheme](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc2397).

### A Note about `locale()`

The locale returned by the various `locale()` methods may not be the same as the preferred locale you passed into the
`ResolveDisplay` function under certain circumstances. For instance, if the locale you passed in wasn't available,
then a default locale may get used instead.

### Resolve Display Examples

The following examples show how the `ResolveDisplay` function can be used. The function requires you to pass in
one or more VCs and the issuer URI.

A preferred locale and/or additional headers to be sent to the issuer can be specified by creating an `Opts`
object, setting your desired parameters using the supplied methods, and passing the object in.

#### Kotlin (Android)

##### Using Default Options

```kotlin
import dev.trustbloc.wallet.sdk.display.*
import dev.trustbloc.wallet.sdk.verifiable.CredentialsArray

val vcArray = CredentialsArray()
vcArray.add(yourVCHere)

val displayData = Display.resolve(vcArray, "Issuer_URI_Goes_Here", null)
```

##### Using Specified Options

```kotlin
import dev.trustbloc.wallet.sdk.display.*
import dev.trustbloc.wallet.sdk.verifiable.CredentialsArray

val vcArray = CredentialsArray()
vcArray.add(yourVCHere)

val opts = Opts().setPreferredLocale("en-us")
val displayData = Display.resolve(vcArray, "Issuer_URI_Goes_Here", opts)
```

#### Swift (iOS)

##### Using Default Options

```swift
import Walletsdk

let vcArray = VerifiableCredentialsArray()

vcArray.add(yourVCHere)

var error: NSError?
let displayData = DisplayResolve(vcArray, "Issuer_URI_Goes_Here", nil, &error)
```

##### Using Specified Options

```swift
import Walletsdk

let vcArray = VerifiableCredentialsArray()

vcArray.add(yourVCHere)

var error: NSError?
let opts = DisplayNewOpts().setPreferredLocale("en-us")
let displayData = DisplayResolve(vcArray, "Issuer_URI_Goes_Here", opts, &error)
```

## Credential Status

After a Verifiable Credential is issued, many credentials support the ability for the issuer to later _revoke_ the
credential, making it no longer valid. If your use case expects that a certain type of Verifiable Credential should
support credential status verification, then you can verify these credentials using a `StatusVerifier`.

A `StatusVerifier` can be instantiated once and used to verify the status of multiple Verifiable Credentials,
using the `verify` API. This will return an error if:
- The provided credential does not support status verification. Your use case will determine whether you should expect
  credentials to support status verification, and your application should handle any logic if you want to handle this
  on a case-by-case basis.
- The status verification process fails, e.g. due to the issuer server being unavailable to report status.
- The credential has been revoked.

By default, `StatusVerifier` only supports status APIs that fetch status metadata via a URL to the issuer's
status endpoint. If you need to also support status APIs that use DID-URL resolution, create a `StatusVerifier`
using the `NewStatusVerifierWithDIDResolver` constructor.

### Examples

#### Kotlin

##### Without DID Resolver

```kotlin
import dev.trustbloc.wallet.sdk.credential.StatusVerifier
import dev.trustbloc.wallet.sdk.verifiable.Verifiable

val cred = Verifiable.parseCredential("Your VC here", opts)

// The StatusVerifierOpts argument is a placeholder for future options.
// There are currently no options that can be set, so pass in null for now.
val statusVerifier = StatusVerifier(null)

try {
    // If no exception is thrown, then status verification succeeded.
    statusVerifier.verify(cred)
} catch (e: Exception) {
    // Status verification failed. Check the exception for details.
}
```

##### With DID Resolver

```kotlin
import dev.trustbloc.wallet.sdk.did.Resolver
import dev.trustbloc.wallet.sdk.credential.StatusVerifier
import dev.trustbloc.wallet.sdk.verifiable.Verifiable

val cred = Verifiable.parseCredential("Your VC here", opts)

val didResolver = Resolver(null)

// In this case, we pass in the DID Resolver, meaning the status verifier supports
// DID-URL resolution for fetching status metadata.
val statusVerifier = StatusVerifier(didResolver, null)

try {
    // If no exception is thrown, then status verification succeeded.
    statusVerifier.verify(cred)
} catch (e: Exception) {
    // Status verification failed. Check the exception for details.
}
```

#### Swift

##### Without DID Resolver

```swift
import Walletsdk

var parseError: NSError?
let cred = VerifiableParseCredential("yourVCHere", nil, &parseError)

var newStatusVerifierError: NSError?
let statusVerifier = CredentialNewStatusVerifier(nil, &newStatusVerifierError)

do {
    // If no exception is thrown, then status verification succeeded.
    try statusVerifier?.verify(cred)
} catch let verifyError as NSError {
    // Status verification failed. Check the error for details.
}
```

##### With DID Resolver

```swift
import Walletsdk

var parseError: NSError?
let cred = VerifiableParseCredential("yourVCHere", nil, &parseError)

var newResolverError: NSError?
let didResolver = DidNewResolver(nil, &newResolverError)

var newStatusVerifierError: NSError?
let statusVerifier = CredentialNewStatusVerifierWithDIDResolver(didResolver, nil, &newStatusVerifierError)

do {
    // If no error is thrown, then status verification succeeded.
    try statusVerifier?.verify(cred)
} catch let verifyError as NSError {
    // Status verification failed. Check the error for details.
}
```

## OpenID4VP

The OpenID4VP package contains an API that can be used by a [holder](https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/#dfn-holders)
to go through the [OpenID4VP](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-4-verifiable-presentations-1_0-ID1.html) flow.

The general pattern is as follows:

1. Create a new `Args` object. An `Args` contains the following mandatory
parameters:
   * An authorization request URI obtained from a verifier (e.g. via a QR code).
   * A crypto implementation.
   * A DID resolver.
2. (optional) Create an `opts` object. To set optional arguments, use the supplied methods available
   on the `Opts` object. For example:
   * `setActivityLogger`: Used to log credential activities.
   * `addHeaders`: Allows you to set additional headers to be sent to the issuer.

   Options can be chained together if you wish (e.g. `newOpts().setActivityLogger(...).setHeaders(...)`).
3. Create a new `Interaction` object using your `Args` and`Opts` objects.
If none of the optional arguments are needed, then a nil `Opts` can be passed in instead.
The `Interaction` object is a stateful object and is meant to be used for a single instance of an OpenID4VP flow and
then discarded.
4. Get the query by calling the `GetQuery` method on the `Interaction`.
5. Select the credentials that match the query from the previous step.
6. Determine the key ID you want to use for signing (e.g. from one of the user's DID docs).
7. Call the `PresentCredential` method on the `Interaction` object with the selected credentials.

### Examples

The following examples show how to use the APIs to go through the OpenID4VP flow using the iOS and Android bindings.
They use in-memory key storage and the Tink crypto library.

#### Kotlin (Android)

import dev.trustbloc.wallet.sdk.localkms.Localkms
import dev.trustbloc.wallet.sdk.localkms.MemKMSStore

val args = Args("YourAuthRequestURIHere", kms.getCrypto(), didResolver)

val activityLogger = mem.ActivityLogger()
val opts = Opts().setActivityLogger(activityLogger) // Optional, but useful for tracking credential activity

// Going through the flow
val interaction = Interaction(args, opts)

## Metrics

Certain Wallet-SDK functionality is able to report back performance metrics to the caller.

Specifically:
* DID creation
* OpenID4CI
* OpenID4VP

To enable metrics reporting, you must pass in a MetricsLogger implementation into the various config/opts objects.
There is an included MetricsLogger implementation that logs messages to standard error (probably will end up in the console) using pre-determined formatting.
This implementation can be used or a custom implementation can be injected.

The object that gets logged when a metrics event occurs is as follows:

* Event: The name of the event that occurred.
* Parent event: The name of the event that encompasses this event. Some longer Wallet-SDK operations log a larger event
that captures the overall time of the method, and during that method some sub-events are also logged. If the parent
event info is empty, then this event is a "root" event. Sub-events always have a duration that is <= the duration of the parent event.
* Duration: How long the event/operation took.

Example metrics event:

* Event: Retrieving token via an HTTP POST request to example.com
* Parent Event: Requesting credential(s) from issuer
* Duration: 6.37ms

### Example event timeline - OpenID4CI flow

Note: performance numbers given below are illustrative only and are not intended to be representative of real-world performance.
```
                                                     Dashed line indicates event duration in timeline, towards the right is further ahead in time - not to scale
                                
 Request credential(s) from issuer (parent event) --------------------------------------------------------- (5.14s)
 Fetch OpenID config (GET)                (event)     ----(2.92ms)
 Fetch token (POST)                       (event)             ----(6.37ms)
 Fetch issuer metadata (GET)              (event)                 ---(919.15µs)
 Fetch credential (POST)                  (event)                      ------(28.87ms)
 Parsing and checking proof               (event)                            ------------------------------ (5.10s)
```
                              
Note that the sum of all sub-event durations may not add up to the duration of the parent event, as not every possible operation during the parent event will be timed.
Generally, short/trivial operations are not tracked.
